# Mitzy
Python application that creates three ASP.NET Web User Control files in the same directory as the exe file. 
The primary use was for my company's applications, but it wouldn't require much adjustment to work with another Kentico app.


# Install
All you need to do is download the exe and click on it when you want to use it. (No python download required. It should just work)


# Instructions
1: Start the app by clicking on the exe. \
2: Insert a name that doesn't use a space or a '-'. Just basically follow .Net naming conventions. \
3: Select a project location. \
3: Add one or more properties. \
4: Make sure that none of the properties are named the same. \
5: Be sure to click on the correct data type (The Radio buttons are acting a little weird). \
6: Once you have named all the properties and have selected the desired data types just click the "Create Web Part!" button
